We studied different line drawing algorithms and circle drawing algorithms and used them to draw emoticons. :mortar_board:

**Selected Emoticon**: :heart_eyes:

## Assignment 1
Learned about the following Line Drawing algorithms, their implementations and their problems - 
 - Digital Differential Analyzer Line Drawing Algorithm
 - Bresenhams Line Drawing Algorithm
 - Midpoint Line Drawing Algortihm

 ## Assignment 2
Learned about the following Circle Drawing algorithms, and finally implemented them to create the emoticon as a deliverable of the assignment.
